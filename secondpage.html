    <h3> Ann Tseng's Hypertext Story: Conclusion </h3>
    <p>Growing up I moved around quite a bit.<br> 
      I was born in Taiwan and spend my childhood travelling between Taiwan, the U.S., & Canada.<br>  
      My family and I lived in Sammamish, Washington when I was 1 to 5 years old.<br>   
      I went back and forth between Taiwan and the United States during that time.<br>
      Moving from place to place has always been a bittersweet experience to me...</p> <br>

      I love learning while being immersed in other cultures, but I have always been a nostalgic person that loves the past. <br>
      Now I have come back to the U.S. for university... <br> 
      and I realized that even though I've moved around a lot, my diverse experiences is something <br>
      that I will always carry with me regardless of where I may be heading off to next.
