    <h3> Ann Tseng's Hypertext Story: Beginning </h3>
    <p>Growing up I moved around quite a bit.<br> 
      I was born in Taiwan and spend my childhood travelling between Taiwan, the U.S., & Canada.<br>  
      My family and I lived in Sammamish, Washington when I was 1 to 5 years old.<br>   
      I went back and forth between Taiwan and the United States during that time.<br>
      Moving from place to place has always been a <a href = "secondpage.html">bittersweet experience to me...</a></p>
